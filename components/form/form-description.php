            There are chances that during the period of work-out, adverse changes might occur such as
            dizziness or fainting. These might be due to an abnormal increase in blood pressure. In rare
            instances, it may lead to a heart attack or stroke which may be a cause of death. Sometimes,
            injuries during participation of the exercise programs might happen that may involve the
            joints, ligaments, muscles, and tendons. It shall be your responsibility to ensure the
            prevention of these during the workout. You do not need to push hard if your body cannot
            make it through yet. Take time and let the progress come in time, gradually.
